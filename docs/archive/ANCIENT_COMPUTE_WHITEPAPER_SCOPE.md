# Ancient Compute Whitepaper Scope

Goal: define a project-level whitepaper covering 12,500 years of computation
and its emulator framework, distinct from the Babbage-only publications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed scope
1. Executive summary: thesis and contributions
2. Timeline overview: prehistoric tally to modern type theory
3. Mechanism progression: physical/analog -> mechanical -> electromechanical
4. Logic graphs: abstract computation models for each mechanism
5. Emulator architecture: shared interface + fidelity tiers
6. Historical validation: primary sources and verification protocol
7. Babbage deep dive: analytical engine as capstone case study
8. Ada Lovelace extensions: tiered classification + disclaimers
9. Cross-mechanism BOM: materials and fabrication constraints
10. Pedagogy: how the curriculum maps to emulators
11. Limitations and future work

Relationship to existing documents
- Babbage whitepapers remain technical manufacturing specs.
- This whitepaper is a synthesis and navigation layer that references those specs.

Deliverables
- One LaTeX source (new) + a short PDF in output/main/
- Appendix with citation matrix and emulator coverage matrix

Open questions
- Whether to include full BOM details or reference the existing Babbage BOM
- Whether to target arXiv format or project-internal format first
