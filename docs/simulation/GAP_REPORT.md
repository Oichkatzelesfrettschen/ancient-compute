Gap Report (DE2 vs Simulation)
- Tolerances: provisional defaults are now recorded and source-cited; numeric
  engineering confirmation remains open.
- Valve timing: provisional lap/lead/cutoff values are now set with source-cited
  timing-clearance references; refine with higher-fidelity valve data in Wave 2.
- Lubrication viscosity/schedule: populated and source-cited from DE2 user manual.
- Card feed/jam rates: first-pass feed/jam profile set from operational guidance and
  cadence-linked jam behavior.
- Steam drive mapping: rpm/pressure profile remains conservative; calibrate against
  measured load behavior in a future physics calibration pass.
