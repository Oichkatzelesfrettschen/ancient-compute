Gap Report (DE2 vs Simulation)
- Tolerances: placeholders present; need page-cited values.
- Valve timing: lap/lead/cutoff TBD; extract from DE2/User Manual.
- Lubrication viscosity/schedule TBD; cite manual.
- Card feed/jam rates: operational notes needed.
- Steam drive mapping: confirm RPM/pressure vs load.
