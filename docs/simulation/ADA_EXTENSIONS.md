# Ada Extensions Beyond Note G

Purpose: track Ada Lovelace program notes beyond the Bernoulli (Note G) deck.

Known items
- Notes A-F: conceptual framing, not full decks
- Notes H-I: commentary on the engine and calculation
- Note G: Bernoulli numbers (deck transcription in docs/simulation/NOTE_G_DECK.yaml)

Status
- Only Note G has a transcribed deck.
- Other notes require extraction of algorithm steps into deck form.

Next targets
- Identify any explicit operation sequences in Notes A-F/H/I.
- Map any algorithmic examples (e.g., integrals, series) to deck steps.
