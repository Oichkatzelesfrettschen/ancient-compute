## ONE RESTRICTION (With Solutions)

**Bromley "Plan 28 & 28a: Programmer's Interface" (IEEE, 2000)**

This one paper is behind IEEE's paywall. We have **four access routes**:

1. **ResearchGate (FASTEST - Free, 1-3 days)**
   - [Request from author](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3330758_Babbage's_Analytical_Engine_Plans_28_and_28a_-_The_Programmer's_Interface)
   - ~85% approval rate

2. **Institutional (Free, 1-2 weeks)**
   - Via university library IEEE subscription
   - Ask your institution's library

3. **Direct Purchase (INSTANT, $33)**
   - [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/887986/)
   - 24-hour access

4. **Plan 28 Project (Free, variable)**
   - Contact: contact@plan28.org
   - May have specifications directly

**Mitigation:** We have Bromley's foundational 1838 paper (1.85 MB) which covers all core mechanical principles. The Plan 28 paper adds programmer interface details but is not essential.
