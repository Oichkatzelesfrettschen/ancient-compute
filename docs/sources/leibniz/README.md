# Leibniz stepped reckoner sources

## Cached files
- `docs/sources/cache/leibniz/wikimedia/Leibnitzrechenmaschine_1280px.jpg`
  - Source page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped_reckoner (links to Wikimedia Commons)
  - Notes: Reference photo; not a primary technical description.

## Known primary-source lacunae
- Leibniz Archive (Hanover) manuscript scans and contemporary descriptions of the machine.
- Museum technical drawings / dimensions / stepped-drum geometry needed for Tier-2 simulation and BOM.
- CNAM object records and high-resolution images (inventory results exist in `docs/sources/cache/CNAM_Leibniz_ccProxy_search.json`), but the ccProxy imageproxy host appears unreachable from this environment (timeouts).
