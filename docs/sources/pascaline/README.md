  - Source page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascaline (links to Wikimedia Commons)
  - Notes: This is a museum object photograph (CnAM). It is a good reference image, but not a full primary technical description.
- `docs/sources/cache/pascaline/internetarchive/14BlaisePascal/14-Blaise-Pascal.pdf`
  - Source page: https://archive.org/details/14BlaisePascal
  - Notes: French article about Blaise Pascal; likely includes Pascaline context but still not the 1645 primary account.

## Known primary-source lacunae
- CNAM collection record(s) and high-resolution scans for the Pascaline mechanism (inventory IDs in `docs/sources/cache/CNAM_Pascaline_ccProxy_search.json`), but the referenced `163.173.128.91` imageproxy host is not reachable from this environment (timeouts).
- Engineering drawings / dimensions / tolerances needed for a real BOM and Tier-2 mechanical simulation.
