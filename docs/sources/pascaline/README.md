# Pascaline sources

## Cached files
- `docs/sources/cache/pascaline/wikimedia/Pascaline-CnAM_823-1-IMG_1506-black_1200px.jpg`
  - Source page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascaline (links to Wikimedia Commons)
  - Notes: This is a museum object photograph (CnAM). It is a good reference image, but not a full primary technical description.

## Known primary-source lacunae
- CNAM collection record(s) and high-resolution scans for the Pascaline mechanism (inventory IDs in `docs/sources/cache/CNAM_Pascaline_ccProxy_search.json`), but the referenced `163.173.128.91` imageproxy host is not reachable from this environment (timeouts).
- Engineering drawings / dimensions / tolerances needed for a real BOM and Tier-2 mechanical simulation.
