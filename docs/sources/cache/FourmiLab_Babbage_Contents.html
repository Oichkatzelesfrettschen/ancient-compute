            L. F. Menabrea, translated and with extensive commentary
            by Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace.  This 1842 document is the
            definitive exposition of the Analytical Engine, which
            described many aspects of computer architecture and
            programming more than a hundred years before they were &ldquo;discovered&rdquo;
            in the twentieth century.  If you have ever doubted, even for
            a nanosecond, that Lady Ada was, indeed, the First Hacker,
            perusal of this document will demonstrate her primacy beyond a shadow
            of a doubt.</li>


    <li><a href="lpae.html">&ldquo;On the Analytical Engine&rdquo;</a>, Chapter VIII of
            Charles Babbage's 1864 autobiography, <cite>Passages from
            the Life of a Philosopher</cite>.</li>


    <li><a href="baas.html">The Report of the Committee</a> of the
            British Association for the Advancement of Science which,
            in 1878, recommended against constructing
            the Analytical Engine.</li>


    <li><a href="hpb.html">&ldquo;The Analytical Engine&rdquo;</a>, paper by
            Major-General Henry P. Babbage (Charles Babbage's son),
            read at Bath on September 12th, 1888; published in the
            <cite>Proceedings of the British Association, 1888</cite>.</li>


    <li><a href="hpb1910.html">&ldquo;Babbage's Analytical Engine&rdquo;</a>, a 1910 paper by
            Henry P. Babbage published in the
            <cite>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</cite>
            <b>70</b>, 517&ndash;526, 645 [Errata] (1910), describing his
            construction of a portion of the Mill and Printing Apparatus,
            used to compute a table of multiples of &pi;.</li>


    <li><a href="pascal.html">&ldquo;Pascal's Calculating Machine&rdquo;</a>.  After
            years of work, in 1645 Blaise Pascal built a gear-based
            mechanical adding machine.  This document is Pascal's
            disclosure of the operation of the machine and the
            grant of a patent upon it in 1649 by Louis XIV, king of France.
            This is the original text; even if you're comfortable
            reading modern French, you'll probably find this
            seventeenth century document rather quaint.</li>

<li>The Analytical Engine Emulator
    <ul class="inner">
    <li><a href="cards.html"><em>Programming Cards.</em></a>  A detailed description of the various
        cards used to program The Analytical Engine emulator, including
        a number of ready-to-run examples.</li>

    <li><a href="emulator.html"><em>The Web Emulator</em></a> describes
        an Analytical Engine emulator which runs within a Web page.
        If your browser supports HTML5 and JavaScript, you can
        run Analytical Engine simulations with no additional
        software or installation.</li>

    <li><a href="cmdline.html"><em>The Command-Line Emulator.</em></a>  Documentation,
        in Unix manual page style, of <b>aes</b>, a command-line
        emulator for The Analytical Engine which you can download
        in either ready-to-run object code or source code form, which
        runs on any computer with a compatible Java virtual machine
        implementation.</li>

    <li><a href="sample.html"><em>Sample Programs</em></a> describes
        several programs, all of which you can run in the Web
        Emulator, which illustrate applications of The Analytical
        Engine in a variety of fields.</li>

    <li><a href="authentic.html"><em>Is the Emulator Authentic?</em></a> discusses
        the challenges one faces in developing an emulator for a machine
        which was never actually built, and the rationale behind some
        of the design decisions made in implementing it.  Various aspects of
        The Analytical Engine are compared to those of both early electronic
        and present-day computers.</li>

    <li><a href="library.html"><em>The Mathematical Function Library.</em></a>  Babbage
        immediately recognised that one great advantage of the Engine was that
        once a given formula was prepared for it, the cards for that formula could
        be placed in a library and called on whenever evaluation of it was needed
        in the future.  This document describes a modest library of cards for
        evaluating the elementary transcendental functions, illustrating how
        the Engine might compute them.</li>

    <li><a href="applet.html"><em>The Java Applet Emulator</em></a> describes
        an Analytical Engine emulator which runs as a Java applet
        within a Web page.  (<em>Due to security and compatibility
        problems, fewer and fewer modern browsers support Java applets.
        Most users should use the <a href="emulator.html">Web Emulator</a>
        instead.</em>)</li>
