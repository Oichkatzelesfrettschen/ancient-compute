ADA LOVELACE
"The analytical engine has no pretensions
to originate anything. It can do whatever
we know how to order it to perform. It
can follow analysis, but it has no power
of anticipating any analytical relations or
truths."
Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was an English mathematician and writer, known for her
work on the Analytical Engine - a mechanical general-purpose computer proposed
by Charles Babbage. Lovelace is considered to be the world's first computer
programmer, as she wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a
machine. Lovelace's contributions to computer science were largely unrecognized
during her lifetime, but she is now celebrated as a pioneer in the field, and her
legacy has inspired countless women to pursue careers in STEM.

The First Computer Programmer

The Analytical Engine was a theoretical mechanical computer that used punch cards
to input data and perform calculations, much like modern computers. Lovelace
recognized its potential to perform more than just mathematical calculations, e.g.
manipulating symbols and creating new forms of artistic expression.
Her most famous work, "Notes on the Analytical Engine," describes how the
machine could be programmed to perform a variety of tasks, including creating
music and graphics. She also wrote an algorithm for the engine to calculate
Bernoulli numbers, a sequence of rational numbers that arise in number theory.

Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the
two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next number in the sequence
is the sum of the previous two numbers. So the first few numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... The equation for the nth fibonacci number is:

Experiment

𝐹! = 𝐹!"# + 𝐹!"$

Implement the Fibonacci sequence in Python. There are several ways to do this, and here we
provide some hints:
1. Definte a function that takes an input nth, and outputs Fn
2. Use if statements to initialize F0 = 0, and F1 = 1.
3. Use for loops to obtain plotting coordinates of spiral
