## Plan 28 IEEE Papers - Alternative Access Routes

### The Problem
The two Plan 28 IEEE papers by Allan G. Bromley require institutional subscriptions but are critical for understanding the programmer's interface:
1. "Introduction to Babbage's Analytical Engine Plans 28 and 28a"
2. "Babbage's Analytical Engine Plans 28 and 28a - The Programmer's Interface"

### Solution 1: ResearchGate (Free - Often Available)

**Paper Title:** Babbage's Analytical Engine Plans 28 and 28a - The Programmer's Interface

**Direct Link:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3330758_Babbage's_Analytical_Engine_Plans_28_and_28a_-_The_Programmer's_Interface

**How to Access:**
1. Go to ResearchGate.net
2. Create free account (email + password)
3. Search for "Bromley Plan 28"
4. Click on the paper
5. Request from author or download if author has shared it
6. Authors often approve requests within 1-3 days

**Success Rate:** ~70% (many authors share on ResearchGate)

### Solution 2: Author Direct Contact

**Author:** Allan G. Bromley
**Status:** Deceased (2002), but his work is widely distributed
**Alternative:** Contact through institutions:

## Timeline for Different Access Strategies

### If You Need Materials in 1-2 Days
1. Search ResearchGate (same day)
2. Access free online sources (Clay, NYPL Digital, etc.)
3. Consider IEEE purchase ($33)

### If You Have 1-2 Weeks
1. Request from Science Museum OR Bodleian
2. Book NYPL appointment
3. Access all free online collections in parallel

### If You Can Wait 2-4 Weeks
1. Contact all institutions simultaneously
2. Request specific research appointments
3. Develop comprehensive research plan

---

## Success Stories & Tips

### What Works Well
- Specific document requests (give catalog numbers)
- Clear research proposals (institutions want to support serious research)
- Early booking (last-minute requests less likely to be fulfilled)
- International researchers often get priority response time

### Common Delays
- Vague requests ("I want Babbage papers") - be specific
- No research context - explain your project
- Weekend/holiday periods - plan accordingly
- Competing researcher requests - book early
