# Babbage Files Relocated Notice

**Date**: November 2, 2025  
**Status**: Files Reorganized

---

## Important Notice

All Babbage Analytical Engine files have been reorganized into a comprehensive, well-structured directory for better organization and discoverability.

### New Location

**All Babbage files are now located in:**
```
BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/
```

### Quick Access

- **Master Index**: [BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/INDEX.md](./BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/INDEX.md)
- **Project Overview**: [BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/BABBAGE_README.md](./BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/BABBAGE_README.md)
- **Complete BOM**: [BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/MASTER_BOM.md](./BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/MASTER_BOM.md)
- **Engineering Blueprints**: [BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/ENGINEERING_BLUEPRINTS.md](./BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/ENGINEERING_BLUEPRINTS.md)

### Directory Structure

### Root-Level Files (Legacy)

The following root-level files are maintained for backward compatibility but are now copied/moved to the organized structure:

- `BABBAGE_ASSEMBLER_SPECIFICATION.md` → `BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/specifications/`
- `BABBAGE_CODE_GENERATOR_SPECIFICATION.md` → `BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/specifications/`
- `BABBAGE_COMPLETE_WHITEPAPER.tex` → `BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/documentation/academic/`
- `BABBAGE_IR_SPECIFICATION.md` → `BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/specifications/`
- `BABBAGE_MASTER_REFERENCE.md` → `BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/specifications/`
- `PHASE_2_RESCOPED_BABBAGE_ISA_TARGET.md` → (Historical planning document, kept at root)
- `WEEK_7_BABBAGE_FOUNDATION_SUMMARY.md` → (Historical summary document, kept at root)

**Recommendation**: Use the organized structure in `BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/` for all new work and references.

### Benefits of New Organization

1. **Single Authoritative Location**: All Babbage materials in one place
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Logical organization by purpose and audience
3. **Comprehensive BOM**: Production-ready across all eras (1910-2025)
4. **Professional Blueprints**: Engineering-grade technical drawings
5. **Easy Navigation**: Master index and clear documentation structure
6. **No Duplication**: Files consolidated, not scattered across repository

### Finding What You Need

**Use the Master Index**: [BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/INDEX.md](./BABBAGE_ANALYTICAL_ENGINE/INDEX.md)

The INDEX provides:
- Quick start guides for different audiences
- Complete directory structure documentation
- Document descriptions and purposes
- FAQ section
- Navigation guides by task
