%% Appendix B: Mechanical Diagram Gallery

\section*{Subsystem Visualization}

This appendix contains detailed mechanical diagrams referenced throughout the whitepaper.

\subsection*{System Architecture}

\input{diagrams/01-system-architecture.tikz}

Five primary subsystems connected via central system bus: Mill (arithmetic), Store (memory), Barrel (control), I/O, and Sequencer (process management).

\subsection*{Carry Propagation Mechanism}

\input{diagrams/02-carry-mechanism.tikz}

Mechanical cascade mechanism enabling addition/subtraction across 50 digit positions. Pawls engage sequentially during carry propagation.

\subsection*{Memory Store Organization}

\input{diagrams/03-store-organization.tikz}

2,000 × 50 matrix memory with address decoding and read/write mechanisms. Each digit wheel is a 12mm gear with 10 positions (0--9).

\subsection*{Process Control Block Layout (Table Form)}

See Table \ref{tab:pcb-layout} in Section \ref{sec:unix-mapping} for detailed PCB structure.

\subsection*{Pipe Buffer Implementation}

The pipe mechanism uses a rotating 8-slot drum with independent read/write pointers. Each slot stores one 50-digit number. Mechanical engagement detects empty/full conditions and blocks reader/writer as appropriate.

\subsection*{Digit Wheel Assembly}

Each digit wheel is a precisely cut gear:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Diameter: 12 mm
    \item Material: Hardened steel
    \item Number of teeth: 10 (representing digits 0--9)
    \item Tolerance: ±0.15 mm (hobbing accuracy)
    \item Mounting: Press-fit onto shaft
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bearing Configuration}

Two bearing types used throughout:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Timken roller bearings (high-speed drives): Superior load rating, lower friction
    \item Bronze journal bearings (low-speed): Cost-effective, adequate for carry mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Assembly Integration Points}

Key interfaces between subsystems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mill output to Store write-path
    \item Store read-path to Mill input
    \item Barrel to Mill (opcode lines)
    \item Barrel to Sequencer (process control)
    \item I/O devices to Store (card data buffering)
\end{enumerate}
