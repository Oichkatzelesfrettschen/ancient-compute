## FAQ

**Q: Has anyone actually built this?**
A: No physical Engine has been manufactured using this specification. The whitepaper provides evidence it's feasible. This is academic verification, not proof of practice.

**Q: Can I build one?**
A: Yes, if you have the resources and expertise. Start with [OPTIMAL_BABBAGE_SPECIFICATION.md](./OPTIMAL_BABBAGE_SPECIFICATION.md) and [SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCUREMENT_GUIDE.md](./SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCUREMENT_GUIDE.md).

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: £7,700-13,000 per unit (including facility setup). See [ECONOMIC_MODELS_MASS_PRODUCTION.md](./ECONOMIC_MODELS_MASS_PRODUCTION.md).

**Q: How long does manufacturing take?**
A: 18-24 weeks for the first unit. Subsequent units take 12-20 weeks depending on region.

**Q: Where do I get the components?**
A: See [SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCUREMENT_GUIDE.md](./SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCUREMENT_GUIDE.md). All suppliers are historically verified for existence in 1930-1960.
