  - Total: ₹1,250 (£75)
  - Lead time: 8-12 weeks
  - Quality: Basic structural steel, manual inspection

- **Argentina**: SOMISA (founded 1960, NOT available pre-1930)
  - Alternative: Import from UK (Sheffield) via Buenos Aires
  - Steel bar stock: 500 kg @ £0.25/kg (including import duties)

  - Cost: 10-15x more expensive than bushings
  - 200 bearings @ £0.50 each = £100
  - Lead time: 20-30 weeks (shipping from Europe)

**Recommendation**: Use bronze bushings for 80% of applications; import precision ball bearings only for critical high-speed shafts.

#### Gears

- Use parametric CAD for easy iteration
- Prototype with 3D printing before committing to CNC
- Source bearings and fasteners from reputable suppliers (McMaster, Misumi)

### Supplier Diversification

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Single-source risk**: Identify alternative suppliers for all critical components
- **Regional risk**: Distribute sourcing across multiple countries/regions
- **Quality risk**: Implement incoming inspection and testing procedures
- **Lead time risk**: Maintain buffer stock for long-lead-time items

**Recommended Approach:**
- 70% primary suppliers (lowest cost, proven quality)
- 20% secondary suppliers (backup, competitive pricing)
- 10% spot purchases (opportunistic, price-sensitive items)
