## SECTION 5: COST SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### What if scenarios?

#### Scenario A: 24/7 Hobbing Unavailable (Single-shift operation)

**Impact**:
- Gear hobbing time: 1,515 hours ÷ 8 hours/day = 189 days = 26.9 weeks
- Schedule extends from 34 weeks to 40+ weeks
- Additional labor cost: 6 weeks × £3,500/week = £21,000
- **Total impact**: +£21,000 (+7.2%)

**Mitigation**: Subcontract 40% of wheels (£300 additional cost) → Reduce to 35-week schedule

#### Scenario B: Equipment Breakdown (Gear hobber machine failure)

**Impact**:
- Rental of replacement machine: £40/week × 13 weeks = £520
- Repair of original: £5,000 estimated
- Labor lost (2 weeks waiting for repair): £28,000
- **Total impact**: +£33,520 (+11.4%)

**Mitigation**: Maintenance contracts, spare parts buffer, subcontracting option

#### Scenario C: Labor Cost Inflation (Wages increase 20%)

**Impact**:
- Base labor: £177,600 × 1.20 = £213,120
- Shift premium: £2,400 × 1.20 = £2,880
- **Additional cost**: £37,800 (+12.9%)
- **Total project cost**: £331,084

**Mitigation**: Fixed labor contracts, performance bonuses (fixed pool), automation (if possible)

#### Scenario D: Material Cost Spike (Steel prices increase 30%)

**Impact**:
- Steel cost: £120 × 1.30 = £156
- Additional cost: £36 (+0.02%)
- **Total impact**: Negligible (+0.01%)

**Note**: Material costs are minor in overall budget; labor dominates (98.1%)

## SECTION 7: COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### How to reduce cost while maintaining quality

#### Strategy 1: Materials Optimization

- **Source locally**: Use India-based Tata Steel instead of importing (saves £200+ on shipping)
- **Bulk purchasing**: Order fasteners in larger quantities (2% discount per 1,000 units)
- **Scrap reduction**: Improve manufacturing yield from 94% to 96% (saves £300 on replacement material)
- **Potential savings**: £500-800 (~0.3%)

#### Strategy 2: Labor Efficiency

- **Cross-training**: Reduce shift premium by using flexible staffing (saves £1,000)
- **Overtime instead of new hire**: More efficient than hiring 3 shift staff (saves £2,000)
- **Apprentice promotion**: Train apprentices for mid-level roles (saves £3,000)
- **Potential savings**: £6,000 (~3.4% of labor)

#### Strategy 3: Subcontracting

- **Subcontract 40% of digit wheels**: £300 cost, saves 6+ weeks labor (break-even or slight savings)
- **Subcontract sector wheel milling**: £500 cost, eliminates second mill rental (saves £2,000)
- **Subcontract fastener plating**: £100 cost, frees up facility (saves £500)
- **Potential savings**: £1,800 net (~1%)

#### Strategy 4: Equipment Optimization

- **Rent vs. buy gear hobber**: Lease for 13 weeks at £40/week = £520 vs. buying at £50,000 (savings significant if not reusing)
- **Consolidate tooling**: Use multi-purpose tools instead of specialized ones (saves £200)
- **Potential savings**: £1,000-2,000 (~0.5%)

#### Combined Optimization Potential: **£10,000-12,000 (~4% total cost reduction)**

---

## SECTION 8: FINANCIAL CONTINGENCY & RESERVES

### Contingency Fund Management

**Total contingency allocated**: £25,869 (15% of direct costs)

**Contingency usage policy**:

1. **Trigger thresholds**:
   - Single variance > £2,000: Notify engineering lead
   - Weekly variance > 2%: Review and plan mitigation
   - Cumulative variance > 5%: Escalate to project manager

2. **Approval authority**:
   - Under £1,000: Manufacturing engineer approval
   - £1,000-5,000: Engineering lead approval
   - Over £5,000: Project manager + finance approval

3. **Contingency reserve tiers**:
   - **Tier 1** (50% of contingency): Emergency equipment replacement, critical rework
   - **Tier 2** (30%): Labor overtime, schedule acceleration
   - **Tier 3** (20%): Material cost overages, miscellaneous

**End-of-project reserve**: If contingency not fully used, 50% returned to sponsor, 50% retained for post-project warranty/support
