| Automatic screw machine | 5-6 | 125 fasteners/hr | 64 hours / 80-hr capacity = 80% |

**Bottleneck Analysis**:
- **Hobbing machine**: 105% utilization (24/7 operation required; confirmed bottleneck)
- **Sector wheel milling**: 104% utilization (need 2 mills OR subcontract 30%)

**Mitigation**: 
- Hobbing: 24/7 operation (primary mitigation, selected)
- Milling: Hire second horizontal mill or subcontract sector wheels to job shop

## SECTION 6: RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### 6.1 Critical Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gear hobber machine breaks (spindle bearing wear) | 15% | 4 weeks delay | (A) Keep spare spindle bearing in stock; (B) Subcontract 40% to job shop |
| Hobbing tool life shorter than expected | 20% | 2 weeks delay | Negotiate extra hobs from supplier; test new hob design with first batch |
| Digit wheel blank supplier late | 10% | 3 weeks delay | Order +20% safety stock; negotiate priority shipping |
| Assembly team discovers design flaw | 25% | 1-2 weeks rework | (A) Validate mill assembly on first stack (week 13); (B) Design review before full production |
| Sector wheel milling bottleneck exceeds estimate | 30% | 2-3 weeks delay | Hire 2nd mill or subcontract 30% to external shop immediately |
| Labor strike or absenteeism | 10% | 2-4 weeks delay | Cross-train backup operators; maintain good labor relations |
| Final assembly integration issues (binding gears) | 40% | 1-2 weeks rework | Extensive hand-crank testing (week 20-21); adjust lever positions if needed |
| Calculation test failures (logic errors) | 25% | 1-2 weeks debug | Develop simple test programs first; verify logic before complex programs |

### 6.2 Schedule Contingency

**Built-in Buffer**: 
- 34-week target includes 2-3 weeks of contingency in weeks 20-24 (testing & debugging)
- If major issues arise earlier (e.g., weeks 12-18), can extend to 36-38 weeks
- Mitigation option: Parallel subcontracting can compress critical path by 2-3 weeks if needed

### 6.3 Quality Risk Mitigation

| Quality Risk | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Digit wheel bore out of tolerance | SPC monitoring every 25 wheels; re-drill if drift detected |
| Bearing bore honing surface finish poor | Use tested honing stone; validate first bore before full production |
| Mill assembly binding due to misalignment | Verify first stack's free rotation before continuing (week 13 gate) |
| Final assembly integration failure | Extensive hand-crank testing; replace bearings if needed (cost: £100) |
| Test program failures due to logic errors | Start with simple programs (addition, subtraction); debug before complex operations |

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **24/7 hobbing operation** for gear wheels (critical path mitigation)
2. **SPC quality control** to catch manufacturing drift early
3. **Parallel subassembly** to overlap construction phases
4. **Rigorous testing** before final assembly to catch design issues
5. **Experienced leadership** (engineering lead + manufacturing engineer) to troubleshoot

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Timeline: 34 weeks (8 months) for single prototype
- Cost: £112,300 (all-in for single unit)
- Quality: 94-96% yield on manufactured components; 80%+ test pass rate on final system
