### Link Format
All links use relative paths for portability:
```markdown
[../ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN/ARCHITECTURE.md]../../ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN/ARCHITECTURE.md)
[../GETTING_STARTED/README.md](../GETTING_STARTED/README.md)
[./HISTORICAL_AUDIT_AND_CORRECTIONS.md](./HISTORICAL_AUDIT_AND_CORRECTIONS.md)
```

### Navigation Patterns
- Hierarchical navigation (root → directory → file)
- Cross-sectional navigation (between related directories)
- Return navigation (back to parent)
