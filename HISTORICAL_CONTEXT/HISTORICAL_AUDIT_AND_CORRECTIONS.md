## CRITICAL CORRECTIONS REQUIRED

### CORRECTION 1: Argentina CMM Anachronism

**Issue**: Argentina 1952 variant specified CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) for quality verification
**Historical Fact**: CMM first developed 1950s (Ferranti), public debut 1959, 3-axis 1960s
**Impact**: CMM unavailable in 1952 Argentina (6-8 year anachronism)

**Recommended Fix**:
Replace CMM-based QC procedure with:
- Precision gauge blocks (available 1910s+)
- Micrometer measurement (available 1800s+)
- Optical comparator (available 1930s+)
- Manual CMM-style measurement (slower but achievable)

**Status**: CORRECTED in whitepaper version

---

### CORRECTION 2: Sheffield Gear Works Company Name

**Issue**: "Sheffield Gear Works" used throughout specification but no historical company found
**Historical Fact**: Actual verified manufacturers:
- David Brown Ltd. (Sheffield, founded 1860, worm gears, diversified 1930s)
- Highfield Gears (Sheffield, founded 1927)
- Bell Gears (Sheffield, established)

**Recommended Fix**:
Replace references to "Sheffield Gear Works" with:
- "David Brown Ltd. (Sheffield)" for primary supplier
- Alternative: "Sheffield-based gear manufacturers" (collective)

**Status**: CORRECTED in whitepaper version

---

### CORRECTION 3: Timken India Direct Supply Assumption

**Issue**: Assumed Timken supplied India directly in 1930s; not verified
**Historical Fact**: Timken had UK (1901) and South Africa (1932) operations; India operations confirmed only "around 2000"

**Recommended Fix**:
Change sourcing from:
- "Timken Company (London agent)" ✓ VERIFIED
Change to:
- "Timken Company (via London agent)" ✓ REALISTIC
- Alternative: "British bearing distributors" if Timken direct unavailable

**Status**: CORRECTED in whitepaper version

---

### CORRECTION 4: Tolerance Specifications for Developing-Nation Shops

**Issue**: Specified ±0.15mm and ±0.10mm tolerances achievable in 1930s local shops
**Historical Reality**: 
- Developed nations with precision equipment: ±0.05-0.15mm feasible
- Developing nations without precision equipment: ±0.25-0.5mm more realistic
- India 1935: Had access to Sheffield equipment but local shops limited

**Recommended Fix**:
- **For imported/precision components**: Specify ±0.10-0.15mm (use Sheffield, SKF, etc.)
- **For local manufacturing**: Specify ±0.25-0.30mm with local quality control
- **For Assembly**: Recommend 20-30% tolerance stack-up margin

**Status**: NOTED in whitepaper with regional variations
